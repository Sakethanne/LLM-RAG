Introduction: What is SQL?

## To get introduced to SQL, we first need to know about Databases and Database Management Systems(DBMS). Data is basically a collection of facts related to some object.

A Relational Database Management System is a collection of tools that allows the users to manipulate, organize and visualize the contents of a database while following some standard rules that facilitate fast response between the database and the user side.
